      <p>
        I'm Oana Demian, MSc,
        <a href="Board Certified Behaviour Analyst" target="_blank">
          Board Certified Behaviour Analyst (BCBA)
        </a>
        and I love helping children develop skills for life through practical
        play.
      </p>

      <p>
        With over a decade of experience using the principles of
        <a href="Applied Behaviour Analysis" target="_blank">
          Applied Behaviour Analysis (ABA)
        </a>
        to help young learners build their capabilities, I've had the
        opportunity to support a wide range of families by assessing and
        designing effective therapy programmes for children, providing caring
        training to tutors, teachers and parents liaising with teachers and
        other professionals and having a lot of hands on fun doing practical
        play with a host of wonderful children.
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe that with the right support every child can further their
        skills and has the potential to become an active member of their
        community.

      <h2>What Practical Play provides</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h3>Initial Consultation</h3>
          <p>
            An initial phone conversation is followed by a video / home
            consultation where I meet the family, find out about the child,
            discuss the parents' concerns and goals and together we consider a
            therapy path taylored to the their situation and needs.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h3>Baseline Assessments</h3>
          <p>
            A baseline assessment includes an in depth interview with the
            parents, checklists and
            <a href="direct assessments" target="_blank">direct assessments</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Direct assessments are standardised tests such as:
            <li>
              Verbal Behaviour Milestones Assessment and Placement Programme
              (VB-MAPP)
            </li>
            <li>Early Start Denver Model (ESDM)</li>
            <li>
              Assessment of Basic Language and Learning Skills- Revised
              (ABLLS-R)
            </li>
            <li>Promoting the Emergence of Advanced Knowledge (PEAK)</li>
            <li>Assessment of Functional Living Skills (AFLS)</li>
            <li>Essentials for Living (EFL)</li>
          </p>

          <p>
            I come to observe the child in a familiar setting - home, community
            and/or educational setting - to assess the child's skills in the
            areas of language, social, play, and other
            <a href="learning domains" target="_blank">learning domains</a>. I
            also evaluate the child's barries to language and learing. It is
            usually a 3-4 hours assessment but it can run over one or multiple
            sessions, depending on the child's age, areas of functioning,
            behaviours of significance, time and setting limitations.
          </p>
          <h4>Learning domains</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Expressive Communication</li>
            <li>Receptive Communication</li>
            <li>Imitation</li>
            <li>Joint Attention</li>
            <li>Gross and Fine Motor Skills</li>
            <li>Social Skills and Engagement</li>
            <li>Play Skills</li>
            <li>
              Personal Independence Skills: eating, dressing, grooming, personal
              hygiene, chores
            </li>
            <li>Classroom and Group Skills</li>
            <li>Community Skills</li>
            <li>Academic Skills</li>
            <li>Health and Safety Skills</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            The results of the assessment yield a baseline inventory of a
            child's skills, and compare it to those of typically developing
            peers. This provides a starting point for the development of the ABA
            programme.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Individualised treatment plan</h3>
          <p>
            Every child and family are unique. Learners have different
            interests, abilities and weaknesses. An individulised treatment plan
            that targets the child's skills and deficits in each area of
            learning is developed based on the results of the baseline
            assessment, while also considering learner preferences and overall
            family situation.
          </p>

          <p>
            The ABA programme will be delivered by ABA therapists during set
            sessions. Sessions can vary in duration and can take place across
            environments : home, school, community. Emphasis is placed on
            intensive teaching of functional skills in a fun,
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h3>Initial Workshop and Periodic Programme Supervision Meetings</h3>
        </li>
        <p>
          Programme Supervision Meetings take place regularly, usually biweekly
          or monthly. The ABA therapists, parents and BCBA meet to review the
          child's progress, monitor and update the programmes, and address
          behavioural concerns.
        </p>

        <p>
          Direct interactions of the BCBA with the child, direct observations of
          the child interacting with the tutors and parents, review of the data
          collected by the tutors and parents since the last meeting are
          required to make informed decisions regarding the treatment plan and
          ensure progress.
        </p>

        <p>
          Parents are encouraged to take part in the meetings and discuss future
          goals and current challenges they want the ABA team to address during
          the ABA sessions.
        </p>

        <li>
          <h3>Progress Reports</h3>
          <p>
            Follow up reports are written every 6 to 12 months, usually for
            Education and Healthcare Plan, Annual Review or Educational
            Tribunal. Their purpose is to justify continuation of services. They
            report progress on current goals, revise goals that have not been
            met, propose new goals, revise current treatment plans and propose
            new treatment plans.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2><i>Services and </i>Fees</h2>
      <p>
        I want to make accessing ABA services as easy as possible. I understand
        that in many cases, the services need to adapt to the family's
        resources. Below are my services and fees:

            A baseline assessment is a one off session where the BCBA observes
            and directly tests the child's skills in different learning domains.
            It typically lasts between 3 to 4 hours depending on the
            difficulties your child is experiencing. The initial assessment fee
            includes a detailed report, which will consist of an in depth write
            up of the assessment session, description of the assessments used,
            results and therapy programme. You will receive the report within a
